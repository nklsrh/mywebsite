			<h2>GAME DEVELOPER. <br>WEB DESIGNER.</h2>
			I've been designing games since I was 15. QBASIC, VB, Visual Basic.NET, XNA, Processing, HTML5 Canvas and WebGL are what I've used to create them.
			<br><br>
			I've won a few awards for my games as well;
			<ul><strong>BLASTR - </strong>	Best Independent Game - 2011 Sydney iFEST Games Festival</ul>
			<ul><strong>AXR.1 - </strong>	Overall Winner - 2011 University of Wollongong High Schools in Technology Competition</ul>
			<ul><strong>Bouncy and the Apple - </strong>		Winner for November - 2011 Mozilla Developer Derby</ul>

			<p>
			Made in 8 weeks for my Industrial Technology - Multimedia HSC subject, 
			it's a fully interactive walkthrough of the fictional 'AXON Racing Team' 
			and its Tech Centre, Garage as well as a private Testing Circuit. 
			<br><br>
			You will be able to pilot the AXR.1 experimental hovercar prototype using a real-world 
			Logitech Driving Force GT racing wheel which includes Force-Feedback effects for 
			a great driving experience.
			<br><br>
			It includes a 'Time Trial' styled game mode, where you have to beat a set target time. 
			There is also a short trophy presentation if you beat the challenge.
			<br><br>
			All the assets were created by me in 3dsMax Design '10, Inkscape, Photoshop CS5. 
			The project was coded within the XNA framework using C#.
